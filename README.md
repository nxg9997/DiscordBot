# DiscordBot

This is a Discord bot I created in order to help facilitate RIT Esports Rocket League Try-outs. The basic functionality allows the bot to move users to different voice channels based on data entered in data.py, as well as the current round of tryouts. This makes moving users to different voice channels easy and automated.
